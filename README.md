## RestNet Implementation using PyTorch
This repository contains an implementation of the ResNet50 architecture using PyTorch. ResNet50 is a deep convolutional neural network that is widely used for various computer vision tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation.

## Introduction
ResNet50 is a variant of the ResNet architecture introduced by Kaiming He et al. in their paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition". It consists of 50 layers and is known for its ability to train very deep neural networks effectively. This implementation provides a modular and flexible way to build ResNet50 networks for various computer vision tasks.

## Features:
-   **Flexible** Usage: Users can create ResNet50 models with different numbers of input channels and classes, making it versatile for different tasks and datasets.
